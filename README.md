# CodersCentralBot2
Hello, its Impact#1704 here. This is all the code I used for the bot I programmed for the <Coders Central> server. This is a copy of the original file, minus my bot token, reddit app, and role ids. You have to fill those out yourselves, because it will be different from mine.

Feel free to fork this or download it, make sure you've downloaded discordpy with "pip install discord.py" also install praw, with pip install praw. I hosted this bot using Heroku, watch Tech with Tim's tutorial on how to host this on Heroku if you want

Have a good day
